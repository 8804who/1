### First face-to-face interview
<p> 
I had an interview for my job yesterday.
I applied for an LLM engineer position because I'm interested in NLP and LLM is top-trend in NLP. <br>
The interview was at the company. Until now, I'd only done video interviews, so this was my first face-to-face interview. Face-to-face interview was felt different with video interview. In video interview, I'd focused on talking about my knowledge and experiences is important. But in a face-to-face interview, I realized interview is a conversation to get to know each other.

### Questions
<p>
The questions are about me and my works. They asked why I came to Seoul(Seoul isn't my hometown) and why I want to be an LLM engineer. I told them my reasons.<br> 
They also asked about my works. I explained them how I did the work and what I learned in that processes.
</p>

### After the interview
I didn't see some of the questions coming and it's a shame that I couldn't answer them well. I should prepare more about interview for getting job.

<p>
ps. Writing in english is challenging for me. I need to study it more.<br>
ps2. If you find a grammatical error, remember that I'm not a native and tell me where it is.
